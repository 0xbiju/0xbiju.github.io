## Attributes
Each Chin Pokie has 6 cosmetic attribute categories and an additional attribute called Fertility. 

Each cosmetic attribute category has a different number of total attributes.
Each cosmetic attribute category has 6 rarities, listed in ascending order by rarity: Common, Uncommon, Rare, Epic, Legendary, Unique.
- Within a specific attribute category, an attribute with a lower rarity will always appear more often than a rarer attribute within that same category. 
- Unique attributes will appear only once in the whole collection. 
- Distribution quantities for each rarity tier varies per attribute category. Our goal was to distribute attribute rarity as evenly as possible. Due to different numbers of attributes per category, rarity per attribute has some variation. 
  - Ex:  A Legendary Face attribute will always be rarer than Epic Face attribute. 
  - Ex: A Legendary Body attribute is slightly less rare than a Legendary Face attribute. 

Attribute categories can be seen below. Learn more about the cosmetic aspects of each attribute on the Attributes Page. A rarity breakdown of each attribute category has also been included on the attributes page.
