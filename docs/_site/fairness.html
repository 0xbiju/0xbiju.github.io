<p>The Chin Pokies staff want to provide a fair mint experience for all users. To ensure generation quality, the staff WILL look through all generations and replace any generations that donâ€™t meet quality standards. Although the staff will know what all generations lool like, they will not know in what order they will be minted.</p>

<p>The Chin Pokies Metadata will be shuffled just before the reveal. Meaning absolutely no one will know the metadata order during any stage of the mint process until after the reveal.</p>

<p>1% of the supply will be reserved after the Presale mint, however these Chin Pokies will NOT be for staff. They will be reserved in a community wallet for various use. They are NOT the property of any Chin Pokie staff.</p>

<p>Staff will not be reserving any Chin Pokies for personal use. Staff will mint like the rest of the community during the public sale.</p>
