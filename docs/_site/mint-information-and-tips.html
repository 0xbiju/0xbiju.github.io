<h2 id="tips">Tips</h2>

<p>Ensure you have metamask as a backup method of minting if you are using a hardware wallet. While hardware wallets are a best practice security measure, it’s always good to have a plan B.</p>

<p>Refresh <a href="https://chinpokies.com">https://chinpokies.com</a> if you’re hanging around on the page at exactly mint time.</p>

<p>Use <a href="https://www.blocknative.com/gas-estimator?gasType=ethereum">gas responsibly and check gas estimation services</a> for latest prices.</p>

<p>Expect the gas price to be higher than what is quoted as the public sale begins.</p>

<p>Use etherscan’s pending transaction page to see what gas prices others are using to help inform your own gas strategy.</p>

<p>Be aware that you and many others may be attempting to mint the last remaining Chin Pokies. The website will refresh the remaining count whenever the mint button is clicked.</p>
