<p>The name and Intellectual Property involved in the Chin Pokies NFT Project (“Chin Pokies”) is owned by the Chin Pokies founders. All rights that are not specifically granted to the users and owners of Chin Pokies below are reserved by the team or potential future DAO. This includes, but is not limited to, the intellectual property rights surrounding the images, names, logos, 3D layer files, trademarks, the website, the ability to mint 3D or voxel or other versions of Chin Pokies, the look and feel of the user interface, the smart contract code, or anything else not specifically granted by any following licenses.</p>

<h3 id="2-what-you-own-and-what-you-can-do-with-it">2. What You Own and What You Can Do With It</h3>

<p>By connecting your Ethereum wallet and minting an NFT with our smart contract, you have purchased a Chin Pokie! You can show off your Chin Pokie, use it as your profile picture, sell it, merchandise it through the sale of physical merchandise, or use your full Chin Pokie in an art piece of your making.</p>

<h3 id="3-specifics-on-commercial-and-derivative-rights">3. Specifics on Commercial and Derivative Rights</h3>

<p>We appreciate your desire to utilize Chin Pokies in various commercial ways, and we are open to you doing just that! However, when it comes to limiting commercial rights, we want you, as an NFT holder, to realize that you may only use the Chin Pokie image in its fullness! The individual layered files and traits are proprietary and are our own creation; therefore, you cannot mint new NFTs that are derivatives of our project, change or add to the original Chin Pokie, or mint another full project using our Chin Pokies in any way. Other than these aforementioned prohibitions, you can create whatever merchandise you would like. The user shall not use any Chin Pokies Licensed Materials in connection with any material, which is unlawful, fraudulent, libelous, defamatory, obscene, pornographic, profane, threatening, abusive, hateful, offensive or otherwise objectionable or unreasonable or infringing upon any laws or regulations or intellectual property rights or proprietary rights or confidentiality obligations and you shall indemnify and defend Chin Pokies against any claims, damages, proceedings, loss or costs arising from such use. The user shall not use the Chin Pokies Licensed Materials in any way that could be construed as being adverse or derogatory to the image of Chin Pokies or any of its subjects featured in the NFTs.</p>

<h3 id="4-no-guarantees-or-future-promises">4. No Guarantees or Future Promises</h3>

<p>The Chin Pokies team hopes to put out more content and create things in the future that you can all be proud of and have outlined many of our intentions as such. However, the landscape around DAOs and various other things we are hoping to do is shifting and legally ambiguous in many ways. When you purchase your Chin Pokie, you agree that your purchase from our initial launch of NFTs is all you are guaranteed to receive in exchange for your funds. Whether through primary or secondary channels, the art is what you receive. Any future benefits are ancillary to this purchase and not to be taken into consideration with your initial purchase. You agree that you are not relying on any future commitments by Chin Pokies.</p>

<h3 id="5-chin-pokies-are-not-intended-as-investments">5. Chin Pokies Are Not Intended as Investments</h3>

<p>Chin Pokies are meant to be a fun Non-Fungible Token for you to collect. They are not meant as investment vehicles. We make absolutely no promise or guarantee that these NFTs will be worth anything more than what you and the market deem the art to be worth. This could very well be zero. We give you our word that we will try to build a community and bring as much intangible value and vibes to the project as we can! You understand that they have no inherent monetary value, and they should be treated as nothing more than a collectible with potential future value or lack thereof.</p>

<h3 id="6-taxes">6. Taxes</h3>

<p>You are entirely responsible for any tax liability which may arise from minting or reselling your Chin Pokies NFT.</p>

<h3 id="7-children">7. Children</h3>

<p>The Chin Pokies project is not targeted towards children. By purchasing a Chin Pokie, you are certifying that you are over the age of 18, or above the legal age of your jurisdiction, whichever is greater.</p>
