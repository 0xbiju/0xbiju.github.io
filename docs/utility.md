## Utility Overview
Utility will be implemented primarily in the form of staking. Chin Pokie NFTs will be able to be staked making community members who do so eligible for rewards. Rewards include but are not limited to: \$SWIM token generation, airdrops, raffles, and more. Utility will be developed and implemented post-launch using the aforementioned allocation of mint sale funds. 

## What is \$SWIM?
Swimmers (\$SWIM) are a Chin Pokie specific token that will be used to redeem rewards. Fertility score will determine how much  \$SWIM is generated when Pokies are staked. Additionally, staking with multiple Pokies will result in more \$SWIM generated since more fertility will be utilized. Tokenomics around \$SWIM will be released at a later date. 

## Staking & Rewards
Rewards that will be redeemable through the aforementioned utility process include:
1. Chin Pokies Merchandise - custom merchandise will be 100% redeemable with earned \$SWIM. The only cost for community members will be shipping.
2. Giveaway Access - members actively staking with their Chin Pokie will automatically be entered into WL raffles as well as giveaways for any future releases.
3. Raffles & Auctions - Members can use \$SWIM to enter raffles for Allowlist spots for Gen II Chin Pokies as well as Allowlist spots for collaborative projects. Additionally, members can bid on limited releases & new collections using \$SWIM.

## \$SWIM Tokenomics {: .label .label-yellow }
