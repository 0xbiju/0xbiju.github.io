Each cosmetic attribute category has 6 rarities, listed in ascending order by rarity: Common, Uncommon, Rare, Epic, Legendary, Unique. | Within a specific attribute category, an attribute with a lower rarity will always appear more often than a rarer attribute within that same category. | Unique attributes will appear only once in the whole collection. | Distribution quantities for each rarity tier varies per attribute category. Our goal was to distribute attribute rarity as evenly as possible. Due to different numbers of attributes per category, rarity per attribute has some variation. | Ex: A Legendary Face attribute will always be rarer than Epic Face attribute. | Ex: A Legendary Body attribute is slightly less rare than a Legendary Face attribute. | . | . Attribute categories can be seen below. Learn more about the cosmetic aspects of each attribute on the Attributes Page.

The project has developed into more than just a PFP project with the addition of a utility component which will be delivered post-launch. Learn more about utility below. Art Development . Seven different attribute types were developed for a total of 173 attributes. Each attribute was voted on by our Team, designed, and tweaked to ensure that every Pokie is high quality and inspires smiles. Smart Contract Design . Creating and optimizing our ERC721A smart contract was a primary focus. With our optimizations, there will be little gas increase for minting more than one Chin Pokie in a single transaction. Listing on OpenSea will be free, and gas costs will be minimized to the best of our ability. Phase II Q1 - Q3 2022Preparing for Launch . Community &amp; Social . Community development and social growth is the primary focus here. All of our attention is put into Discord and Twitter, with various practices to keep members engaged and to grow the community. Website Creation . The Chin Pokies website is designed to be transparent and ensure that all aspects of the project are easy to understand and transparent. Mint . 6,969 Chin Pokies will be minted with a target date of the end of Summer. For more information about the mint process visit the mint information page . Phase III - Q4 2022Staking &amp; Rewards . Staking Your Chin Pokie . Review the utility overview page for more details. Merch . Developing and distributing redeemable merch using generated $SWIM token. Auctions &amp; Raffles . Using $SWIM, community members will be given the opportunity to participate in both auctions and raffles for additional, free Chin Pokies as well as spots for future projects. Phase IV - Q1 2023+Looking to the Future . Gen. II Chin Pokies . Potential for additional Chin Pokies release or new NFT releases by the team. Partner Collaborations . We have several teams that have shown interest in partnering with us. During this part of our roadmap, this will be one of our focuses. We’re hoping to develop those relationships and give community members access to those projects as well (by also leveraging $SWIM) . Continuous Development . Phase III doesn’t include everything we’ve come up with. Chin Pokies will be a living, breathing project that is hopefully here for the long haul. Additionally, we will be taking community feedback into account and adding features that are collectively voted on and approved by the community. ",

Fertility will be listed on OpenSea, but will not have a designated rarity. The value here will directly affect staking/utility with a higher Fertility score resulting in more $SWIM generated when staked. Higher rarity attributes will have a higher base Fertility score when being used to calculate a Pokie’s fertility. Each attribute will have a higher floor for their fertility score. Fertility score isn’t just a number, it’s a key component to our algorithm and will help generate tangible rewards as determined by the Team. How is Fertility Calculated? . Each Chin Pokie’s Fertility will be calculated by taking the average of the hidden Fertility score of each individual attribute. The hidden fertility score of each attribute is calculate when generating each Chin Pokie. Meaning the same attribute will most likely have a different hidden Fertility score on different Pokies. The attribute’s rarity influences the hidden Fertility as follows: . | Common - Randomly generated Fertility between 1-10 | Uncommon - Randomly generated Fertility between 1-10 plus 2 | Rare - Randomly generated Fertility between 1-10 plus 4 | Epic - Randomly generated Fertility between 1-10 plus 6 | Legendary - Randomly generated Fertility between 1-10 plus 8 | Unique Pokies- Guaranteed Fertility of 10 | .
